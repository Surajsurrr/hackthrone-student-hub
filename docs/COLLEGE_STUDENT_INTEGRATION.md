# College-Student Event Integration

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented backend integration between college event posting and student dashboard. Events posted by colleges now automatically appear in student dashboards in real-time.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **College Event Management**

#### Post Event (`college/post_event.php`)
- Form with all necessary fields:
  - Event Title
  - Description
  - Date & Time
  - Event Type (Hackathon, Symposium, Project Expo, Workshop)
  - Location
  - Max Participants
- JavaScript form submission to API
- Success notification and redirect
- Auto-refresh student dashboards

#### Manage Events (`college/manage_events.php`) ✨ NEW
- View all posted events
- Event cards showing:
  - Title, description, type
  - Date, time, location
  - Participant limits
  - Current status
- Delete event functionality
- Empty state for no events
- Responsive grid layout

### 2. **Student Dashboard Integration**

#### Upcoming Events Section (Dashboard)
- **Auto-loads** events from database
- Shows next 5 upcoming events
- Displays:
  - Event date (Month & Day)
  - Event title
  - Event type & college name
  - Location (if available)
- **Real-time updates** every 5 minutes
- Empty state when no events

#### Hackathons Page
- Lists all hackathons from all colleges
- Filter by event type
- Complete event details
- Join hackathon functionality
- Responsive grid layout

### 3. **API Endpoints**

#### For Colleges:
- `POST /api/college/createEvent.php` - Create new event
- `GET /api/college/getEvents.php` - Get college's events
- `POST/DELETE /api/college/deleteEvent.php` - Delete event

#### For Students:
- `GET /api/student/getOpportunities.php` - Get all events & jobs
  - Returns events with college names
  - Returns internships with company names
  - Only active events/jobs

### 4. **Database Structure**

```sql
events table:
- id
- college_id (FK to colleges)
- title
- description
- date (DATETIME)
- location
- type (hackathon, symposium, project-expo, workshop, other)
- max_participants
- status (active, cancelled, completed)
- created_at, updated_at
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### College Posts Event:
1. College fills out event form
2. Submits to `createEvent.php` API
3. Event stored in database with `college_id`
4. Success message shown

### Student Sees Event:
1. Student opens dashboard
2. JavaScript calls `getOpportunities.php`
3. API fetches events with college names (JOIN query)
4. Events displayed in "Upcoming Events" section
5. Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes

### Event Updates:
- When college deletes an event → immediately removed from database
- Student dashboard refreshes → event disappears
- Real-time sync maintained
